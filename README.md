# Text-to-PC
Android app to communicate with C# desktop application  via TCP.

## Why
Because I can. I did this just to transfer website urls from the phone to the computer.

## How it works
**First things first, this is used together with the C# TCP application [here](https://github.com/FusRoDah061/CSharp-TCP-app)**

Once in the app, you have three text fields, where you enter the server IP address, the port the server is listening to and the data you wish to send. Then just hit the button on the bottom of the screen, which will send the input data to the server.

*PS: The phone must be connected to the same network as the server.*
